This repository is simply a mirror of the file fpga/hdmi_overlay_0xD_src.tgz
downloaded from http://www.kosagi.com/netv_hardware/ on Jan 19th, 2011.

It seems to contain all the verilog and scripts required to build FPGA firmware
for the NeTV HDMI device from Chumby/Sutajio Ko-Usagi; see
http://www.kosagi.com/blog/ for more information.
